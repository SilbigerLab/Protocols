1. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**
    1. 	Shimadzu UV 2450 spectrophotometer
    1.  Desktop computer
    1.  UV probe software
    1.  3mL glass cuvettes  
    1.  100% acetone
    1.  Chiller (attached to spectrophotometer)

    1. 	Turn the chiller switch to ON
    2.  All the square coils must be submerged in water, usually are already but double check before turning on
    2.  The chiller is pre-set to 25Â°C, do not need to change 
    1.  Open the UV probe program and press CONNECT once loaded, takes around 5-10 minutes to warm up and all checks need to    be green before you begin
    2.  Fine to leave spec on as you set up samples and organize 
    1.  Once everything is green, click OK
    1.  Then click on the icon with a circle and capital M in the middle, methods
    1.  Add three wavelengths (630nm, 663nm and 750nm) as your WL points
    1.  Click next
    1.  Set next screen to MULTIPOINT and 3WL and select desired WL from the dropdown menus
    1.  Click next 
    1.  Keep standard settings 
    1.  Click next
    1.  Keep standard settings
    1.  Click next 
    1.  Select the three dots next to filename and create new folder on desktop , open and add file labeled YourName_Date_Chlorophyll.pho to save there
    1.  Make sure to save information throughout the reading process in case of power failure, etc.
    1.  Click finish and then close
    1.  Fill empty cuvette with 3 mL of acetone to be used as your blank
    1.  Open spectrophotometer slide top
    1.  Use the front black cuvette holder, gently remove the top  
    1.  Place cuvette into the cuvette holder, cover with black top
    1.  Make sure outside of cuvette is clean and use kimwipe if need be
    1.  Close spectrophotometer sliding top
    1.  Make sure in between samples or organization to always keep slide top closed  
    1.  Once blank of acetone is in the cuvette holder, select the Baseline button in program, set starting WL to 800 and ending WL to 300 or pick a desired range that includes the WL you want to measure, then press OK
    1.  Baseline takes around 2 minutes to run through, do this once 
    1.  After running the Baseline, make a label for sample ID under the SAMPLE TABLE not STANDARD TABLE, the sample table is usually underneath so select it so it is most of your screen
    1.  Once you run the Baseline, run the same blank again, this time pressing the READ UNKNOWN button to make sure it reads 0 under all wavelengths in your sample ID row 1 (label sample ID as Blank.1, the number should correspond to which colony you are doing) 
    1.  Label the sample ID row 2, 3 and 4 for each replicate you do (ex: T1.1, T1.2, T1.3) (colony tissue sample 1, replicate 1, 2 and 3)
    1.  Take out blank and dispose of acetone in appropriate waste container, pipette 3mL of first sample into cuvette, repeat steps 20-24
    1.  Press the READ UNKNOWN button, repeat with each sample for each colony
    1.  In between each colony that has 3 replicates, run a blank of acetone and press the READ UNKNOWN button to make sure it reads 0 for all wavelengths before running next colony set
    1.  Make sure to save the data randomly throughout the sampling period, also copy all values down into the notebook
    1.  Press the DISCONNECT button when finished
    1.  Exit the program 
    1.  Switch the chiller and spectrophotometer switches to OFF
    1.  Dispose of samples with acetone in appropriate waste containers, clean up your area and leave the computer ON
