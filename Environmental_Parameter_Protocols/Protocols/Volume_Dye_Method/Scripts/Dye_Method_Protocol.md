*In lab*
1.	Add 1mL, 3mL, 6mL, 9mL, and/or 15mL of blue dye to a few separate falcon tubes. You will choose the falcon tube that is most appropriate according to the size of the pool. Although you might not know the exact volume of a tide pool, you should estimate it in order to pick the correct amount of blue dye. 

*In the field* 
1.	You will begin by pouring the dye from the falcon tube into the body of water. 
  1.There will be some dye left inside of the tube, so it is best to rinse it in the pool of water a few times.
  1.It would also be a good idea to rinse the cap as well, as some of the dye can travel down the tube and leave little droplets of dye in the crevices of the cap. 
 
2.	Thoroughly mix the dye into the pool until it is evenly distributed and looks homogenous.
  1.	It is best if you take your time during this step, especially if it is a complex pool with large amounts of fauna. The more complex the pool, the harder it will be to efficiently mix in the dye.
 
3.	Now that the dye is mixed in, fill at least three falcon tubes from a minimum of three equidistant points in the pool.
  1.	This will ensure that you are taking replicates from the whole pool and not just one area. 
  1.	The amount of water you put in each tube is entirely up to you, but there should be a minimum of 3mL. This is the preferred amount of solution to be added to the cuvettes when using the spectrophotometers. 
 
4.	Once you have finished collecting your samples, make sure to properly label them.
  1.	All the water samples will look relatively the same in color and mixing any of the samples will likely skew the overall absorbency of your samples.
 
5.	This is all that can be done in the field for retrieving absorbency. The rest should be conducted in a lab with the use of a spectrophotometer.

1.	Plug the machine in and let it run its warm-up protocol.
  	1.	It will calibrate itself by testing its ram, measuring its saturation profile, as well as checking its noise levels and absorbency.
  	1.	Check the cuvette chamber to see if it’s empty, making sure there are no cuvettes inside.
  
2.	 There are different modes you can use to measure DNA, proteins, kinetics, etc., but for our purposes, use the Wavelength mode.
  	1.	It will ask you to enter a number (1-3) of wavelengths to read. Choose 1 and press enter. 
  	1.	It will then ask you the wavelength you will be using, which in this case will be 640nm.
 	1.	It will then ask if you want to subtract background reading. Enter NO.
  
3.	The spectrophotometer is now ready to read absorbances.
  
4.	To begin, you must zero the machine with a blank reading.
  	1.	Add DI water to a clean cuvette. Make sure you are using gloves while handling the instrument. Only hold the cuvettes by the frosted sides, assuring that the clear sides are not touched. For the best results, use a pipette to insert 3mL of DI water.
  	1.  Wipe down the clear sides of the cuvette with Kimwipes, assuring that there are no smudges or dust, so that the spectrophotometer can get a clear reading.
  	1.	Insert the cuvette into the chamber. Make sure when inserting, that either clear sides are facing the light path. There will be an arrow indicating the direction in which the clear side of the cuvette should be facing. Close the lid.
  	1.	Press the green button that says Read Blank for the machine to zero out. 
 	1.	Then press the right arrow button to continue.
  	1.	You can now read different absorbances.
  
5.	Much like the previous step, you will be inserting a cuvette containing a substance into the cuvette chamber to find its absorbance. 
  	1.	Always wipe down the cuvette with Kimwipes to ensure the best reading.
  	1.	Each time you place a cuvette into the chamber, close the lid and press the green button that says Read Sample.	The number that appears on the screen will be the absorbency of the substance inside the cuvette.
  	1.	Press Enter to continue.
  
6.	You will continue doing step 5 for however many substances you need to be read. 
  
7.	When finished, you can press the left arrow button to Exit Assay.
  	1.	It will ask if you want to print a full report. Assuming that you have written down all the absorbances, you will choose NO and press enter.
  	1.	Make sure to take out any cuvettes inside the cuvette chamber.
  	1.	You may now unplug the machine.

1.	Plug the machine in.

2.	Turn on the machine.
  	1.	The power button will be on the left side of the machine.

3.	Allow it to run its power-on diagnostics.
  	1.	This is where it will check its RAM, battery, lamp(s), lamp alignment, wavelength calibration, and warm up its lamp(s).
  	1.	Press ENTER to continue.
  	1.	Ideally, you want to allow the lamps to warm up for about 30 minutes before you begin taking any readings.
  
4.	The Genesys 5 has three different modes to choose from; absorbance, % transmittance, and concentration measurements.
  	1.	Make sure the absorbance mode is chosen by using the leftmost arrow to shift between modes, leaving it at A.
  
5.	You will set the wavelength by pressing the GO TO WL button.
  	1.	Type in the wavelength using the number keys and press ENTER when finished. For our purpose, you will be inputting 640nm.
6.	To begin, you must zero the machine with a blank reading.
  	1.	Add DI water to a clean cuvette. Make sure you are using gloves while handling the instrument. Only hold the cuvettes by the frosted sides, assuring that the clear sides are not touched. For the best results, use a pipette to insert 3mL of DI water.
 	 1.	Wipe down the clear sides of the cuvette with Kimwipes, assuring that there are no smudges or dust, so that the spectrophotometer can get a clear reading.
  	1.	Insert the cuvette into the chamber. There are eight cell holders inside the compartment. Choose the first cell that should be labeled ‘B’ on the display screen. You can adjust the cell positions by pressing either CELL buttons. It will move according to the arrow located above/below the CELL. Make sure when inserting, that either clear side is facing the light path. The sensor will be on the left side of the compartment. Close the lid of the compartment.
 	1.	Press the AUTO ZERO button to zero out the machine.
  	1.	You are now ready to begin reading different absorbances

7.	Much like the previous step, you will be inserting a cuvette (or several) containing a substance into the cuvette chamber, to find its absorbance. 
  	1.	Always wipe down the cuvette with Kimwipes to ensure the best reading.
  	1.	Each time you place a cuvette into the chamber, close the lid. The machine will automatically read the absorbance if it is in the cell facing the sensor. To read the absorbance in the next cell, simply press the CELL Arrow button to shift the cells. The number that appears on the screen will be the absorbency of the substance inside the cuvette.
 
8.	You will continue doing step 7 for however many substances you need to be read. 

9.	When finished, you can press the EXIT button to exit the current screen.
  	1.	You will now be on the main menu.
  	1.	Make sure to take out any cuvettes inside the cuvette chamber.
  	1.	Turn the power switch off.
  	1.	You may now unplug the machine.


<a name="Cleaning a cuvette"></a> **Cleaning a cuvette**

1.	ALWAYS make sure you are holding the cuvette by the frosted sides

2.	Pour out the contents inside the cuvette

3.	Rinse the inside of the cuvette at least twice with water

4.	Dry the inside with Kimwipes
 	1.	Its best if you fold a sheet multiple times for it to fit inside
 	1.	Make sure the inside is completely dry. The idea is to avoid leaving any stains or water marks
  	1.	If not dried correctly, it will be very difficult to clean the next time the cuvette is used
  	1.	If you use a cuvette that has not been properly dried, you risk having inaccurate readings

5.	Give the cuvette lids a quick rinse and dry

6.	Allow the cuvette(s) and lid(s) to sit for a few minutes for any residual water that you missed to evaporate

7.	Store in appropriate container(s)
