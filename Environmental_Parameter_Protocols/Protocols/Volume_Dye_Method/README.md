<a name="adding_dye"></a> **Preparing and collecting dyed water samples**  

1. Before heading into the field, use the appropriate pipette(s) to add 1mL, 3mL, 6mL, 9mL, or 15mL of blue dye to a falcon tube.  
    1. If you are unsure how much dye you'll need for the pool you intend to assess, fill multiple falcon tubes with different volumes and label the tubes by their dye volume.
1. Uniquely label at least 3 clean falcon tubes for water collections at your tide pool.
1. Once in the field and at your tide pool, pour the dye from the falcon tube into the pool.  
    1. If you brough multiple dye volumes, consider how much dye you may need to sufficiently dilute the dye in the pool for later analysis.
    1. If necessary, start with the largest volume, and then add the smaller volumes of dye as needed, noting the exact volume of dye added to the pool.
1. There will be some dye left inside the tube, so rinse the tube, cap, and dye in the pool of water until the tube appears clean.
1. Thoroughly mix the dye into the pool until it is evenly distributed and looks homogenous.
  1. It is best to take your time during this step, especially if it is a complex pool with large amounts of fauna. The more complex the pool, the harder it will be to sufficiently mix in the dye.
1. Now that the dye is mixed in, fill three or more falcon tubes from three or more equidistant points in the pool.
  1. This will ensure that you are taking replicates from the whole pool and not just one area.
  1. All the water samples should look relatively the same in color (if the pool was uniformly mixed)
  1. Do not attempt to further mix the samples, as mixing may skew the absorbency of your samples later.

1. Once the spec has run through its warm-up protocol, check that there are no cuvettes inside the cuvette chamber.
  	1.	The spec will calibrate itself by testing its ram, measuring its saturation profile, and checking its noise levels and absorbency.
1. Select the "Wavelength" mode.
  	1. Enter the number of wavelengths to read: only using **1 wavelength**
  	1. Enter the wavelength to use: **640 nm**
    1. Enter if you do or do not want to subtract background reading: **No**. 
1. Running a "blank"
    1. Start with a "blank" reading to calibrate the spec's readings.
  	    1. Add 3mL DI water to a clean cuvette. Make sure you are using gloves while handling the cuvettes, and only hold the cuvettes by the frosted sides, ensuring that the clear sides are not touched or smudged.
    1. Before inserting the cuvette into the spec, wipe down the clear sides with a Kimwipe, and check that there are no smudges or dust.
    1. Insert the cuvette into the chamber such that the clear sides are facing the light path. There will be an arrow indicating the direction in which the clear side of the cuvette should be facing.
    1. Close the lid to the cuvette chamber.
    1. Press the green button that says Read Blank for the machine to calibrate or "zero out". 
    1. After the blank run, press the right arrow button to read absorbances.
1. Running your samples
    1. Pipette 3mL of your sample into a clean cuvette, and wipe down the sides with a kimwipe to remove dust or smudges.
  	1. Each time you place a cuvette into the chamber, close the lid and press the green button that says Read Sample.	The number that appears on the screen is the absorbency of the substance inside the cuvette at your set wavelength.
  	1. Record this absorbance in your lab notebook, and press Enter to continue.
    1. Repeat steps a-c for each of your samples, recording each absorbance as you go. 
1. When finished, press the left arrow button to Exit Assay.
  	1. It will ask if you want to print a full report. Assuming that you have written down all the absorbances, you will choose NO and press Enter.
1. Take out any cuvettes inside the cuvette chamber and [clean each with DI water](#clean_cuvettes).

1. Turn on the spec by pressing the power button will be on the left side of the machine.
1.	Once the spec has run through its warm-up protocol, check that there are no cuvettes inside the cuvette chamber.
  	1. The spec will calibrate itself by testing its RAM, battery, lamp(s), lamp alignment, wavelength calibration, and warm up its lamp(s).
    1. Ideally, allow the lamps to warm up for about 30 minutes before taking any readings.
1. Press ENTER to continue.
1. Choose the Absorbance read mode by using the leftmost arrow until you see "A".
1. Set the wavelength to **640 nm** by pressing the GO TO WL button and typing in the wavelength using the number keys
    1. Press ENTER.
1. Running a "blank"
    1. Start with a "blank" reading to calibrate the spec's readings.
  	    1. Add 3mL DI water to a clean cuvette. Make sure you are using gloves while handling the cuvettes, and only hold the cuvettes by the frosted sides, ensuring that the clear sides are not touched or smudged.
    1. Before inserting the cuvette into the spec, wipe down the clear sides with a Kimwipe, and check that there are no smudges or dust.
    1. There are eight cell holders inside the compartment. Notice which cell is labeled "B" on the display screen. You can adjust the cell positions by pressing either CELL buttons.
    1. Insert the cuvette into the chamber in slot "B" such that the clear sides are facing the light path. The sensor is on the left side of the compartment, so align the clear sides left-right.
    1. Close the lid to the cuvette chamber.
  	1. Press the AUTO ZERO button to "zero out" the machine.
1. Running your samples
    1. Pipette 3mL of your sample into a clean cuvette, and wipe down the sides with a kimwipe to remove dust or smudges.
  	1. Each time you place your single or set of cuvettes into the chamber, close the lid.
    1. The spec will automatically read the abosrbance of the selected cell (on the display screen) once the chamber lid is closed.
    1. To read the absorbance of subsequent cells, simply press the CELL Arrow button to shift the cells. The number that appears on the screen is the absorbency of the substance inside the selected cuvette at your set wavelength.
  	1. Record each absorbance in your lab notebook as you move from cell to cell.
1. Repeat steps a-e as needed for all your sets of samples (or just d-e if you only have one set of samples that can all fit in the spec at once), recording absorbance as you go.
1. When finished, press the EXIT button to exit to the main menu.
1. Take out any cuvettes inside the cuvette chamber and [clean each with DI water](#clean_cuvettes).


<a name="clean_cuvettes"></a> **Cleaning a cuvette**  

1. ALWAYS make sure you are holding the cuvette by the frosted sides
1. Pour out the contents inside the cuvette into the proper waste container or down the sink if your sample contains no chemicals of concern (refer to the MSDS)
1. Rinse the inside of the cuvette at least twice with DI water
1. Dry the inside with a Kimwipe
 	  1. Make sure the inside is completely dry to avoid leaving any stains or water marks
  	1. If not dried correctly, it will be very difficult to clean the next time the cuvette is used
  	1. If you use a cuvette that has not been properly dried, you risk inaccurate readings
1. Rinse the cuvette lids in DI and dry with a kimwipe as well.
1. Allow the cuvette(s) and lid(s) to sit for a few minutes for any residual water to evaporate
1. Store in appropriate clean container(s)
