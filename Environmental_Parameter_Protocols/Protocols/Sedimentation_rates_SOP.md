    1.  Outplant replicate sediment traps at each designated site (n = 3), each trap must be at least 10 cm away from the other. 
    1.  Leave on reef for 48-72 hours.
    1.  During collection, cover the opening of each PVC pipe with a PVC pipe cap. Carefully bring onto boat and stand upright upon return.
    1.  Pre-weigh your 1 μm pore size, 47 mm polycarbonate filter before placing in the vacumm pump stage.
    1.  Filter the entire contents of each sediment trap using a vacumm pump on low pressure on a 1 μm pore size, 47 mm polycarbonate filter. Be careful and watch if the contents are building up to much on the filter, may need to use more than one filter.
    1.  Remove filter from the vacumm pump stage and immediately put into drying oven on a labeled aluminum foil square at 70 °C for 24 hours.
    1.  Carefully remove each sample from the drying oven and weigh the filter and sediment contents.
    1.  Calculate the total dry mass of the sediment samples and divide by the area (Eq. 1) and the duration of the collection period to estimate the average trap collection rate (mg dry sediment cm <sup>-2</sup> day <sup>-1</sup>) (Storlazzi, et al. 2011).
