    1.  Collect replicate *in situ* water samples at each site (n=2).
    1.  Carefullt, bend over the boat into the water as far down as comfortable (about 50 cm below the surface) holding a closed tube.
    1.  Rinse the tube 3 times by opening it underwater, filling it with seawater, closing it, returning it to the surface and emptying. Avoid going through the surface film with the tube open.
    1.  Fill the tube a final time underwater. Close and bring to the surface.
    1.  Decant to 40 mL and close tightly.
    1.  Filter all samples through  a 0.7 μm GF/F using a luer-lok tip 60 mL syringe.
    1.  Place all samples in a -20°C freezer until analysis.
    1.  Submit samples to the University of California, Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute for phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, nitrite, silicate analysis using a flow injection analyzer.
