<a name="Domestic"></a> **Domestic Travel**

1. Log into your CSUN portal: Mynorthridge.csun.edu 
1. Navigate to CSUN Travel > employee eTravel Center
1. Create a Travel Authorization and Cash Advance
    1. Include any expenses you have already accumulated (i.e. hotel rooms, flights, and/or train or bus tickets), and attach receipt pdf documents as proof of purchase.
    1. Include any expenses you expect to have over the course of your trip.  Add food costs ($15/day for food is standard), travel costs, materials you are unable to purchase before your trip, and estimate a buffer sum for incidentals.  It is easier to get approval for these funds before a trip than to go over budget and try to get post-approval.
    1. If you prepaid for travel (ex. Flight, bus, or train tickets), wait for Travel Authorization approval, then Create a Cash Advance using your Travel Authurization number on the Cash Advance form.
    1. For any prepaid expenses you're including in the Travel Authorization and Cash Advance forms, provide pdf attachments of proof of purchase.
        1. Note: If you are requesting an advance through TUC, rather than the Biology Department, [see below](#TUC_Advance).    
    1. Note that you may not be able to receive a cash advance for prepaid hotel reservations.  Include hotel costs in your Travel Authorization, but this receipt may have to be submitted after your trip for reimbursement.
1. During your trip, ask for receipts for every purchase and save these receipts for later reimbursement
1. After your trip, Create an Expense Report for refundable costs during your travel
    1. Fill in a line for every refundable expense from the trip for which you have a receipt.  If you have misplaced any receipts, email Vickie Everhart at vickie.l.everhart@csun.edu for guidance on reimbursement for those expenses.
    1. Turn in your receipts to Vickie at the Biology Office once you've submitted your Expense Report.
