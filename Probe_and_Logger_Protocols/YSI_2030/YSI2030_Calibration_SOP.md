1. Calibrating Dissolved Oxygen
    1. Calibrate <24 hours before sampling.
    1. Connect cable with probe to handheld meter.
    1. Remove the gray slip covering the probe and take out the small circular sponge inside the gray slip.
    1. Lightly dampen the sponge with deionized (DI) water and replace the sponge back inside the gray slip.
    1. Make sure the DI sensor is not already wet (if so, genetly dap with a kimwipe to remove moisture), then place the gray slip back over the probe and leave for 10-15 minutes.
    1. After this time, turn on the instrument and allow the DO readings to stabilize. 
    1. Press and Hold the Cal key.  Highlight Dissolved Oxygen and press enter.
    1. After a moment 'Calibration successful' will display for a few seconds to indicate successful calibration, and then the instrument will return to the home screen.
    1. If unsuccessful, an error message will appear. See troubleshooting guide for solutions.
1. Calibrating conductivity
    1. Calibrate <24 hours before sampling.
    1. Connect cable with probe to handheld meter. 
    1. Fill tall container (ex. graduated cylinder) with new, traceable YSI 3169 conductivity calibration solution. The conductivity sensor is located at the top of the probe and will need to be submerged in the solution (will need to be submerged fully up to the cable).
        1. Pour solution into container while holding the container at an angle to pour contents gently down the side without introducing air bubbles into the solution.
    1. Remove the gray slip covering the probe and fully submerge probe in the solution. Make sure probe is entirely submered in the solution up to the cable. Gently wiggle/agitate the probe to remove any air bubbles from conductivity sensor. 
    1. Turn the instrument on and allow the conductitiy and temperature readings to stabilize.
    1. Press and Hold the Cal key. Highlight Conducivity and press enter.
    1. Highlight the desired calibration method (Sp. Conductance) and press enter. 
    1. Highlight units you wish to calibrate (uS/cm) and press enter. Use the up and down arrow to enter the value of conductivity solution at 25 &deg; C (check the calibration solution for value [i.e. 50,000 us/cm])
    1. The Pro2030 will remember the calibration value and display it the next time you calibrate the probe. 
    1. Press enter to complete the calibration. Or press Cal to cancel the calibration. 
    1. 'Calibration successful' will display for a few sectonds to indicate successful calibration and then the instrument will return to the home screen. 
    1.  If unsuccessful, an error message will appear. See troubleshooting guide for solutions.
1. Cleaning and Storage
    1. Once finished using the probe, thoroughly rinse the entire probe head, especially the probe tips with DI water. Wipe off the probe base, careful not to touch the probe tips.
    1. Dampen the sponge inside the gray slip with DI water, then place the slip over the probe.
        1. The Dissolved Oxygen sensor must be in a humid environment at all times or the probe could be damaged.
        1. If you find the sponge to be dry after long storage, moisten the sponge with DI and leave the probe in the gray slip for at least 24 hours before attempting to calibrate DO.
1. Replacing batteries
    1. Locate the four screws on the center back plate of hte YSI and use a phillips head screwdriver to loosen and remove these four screws and back plate.
    1. Remove the two used C-cell 1.5V batteries and replace with two fresh C-cells.
