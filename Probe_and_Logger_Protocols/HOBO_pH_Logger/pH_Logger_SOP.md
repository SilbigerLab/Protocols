<a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**  

- HOBOconnect app installed on phone or tablet
- HOBO pH Logger (MX2501)
- Probe storage solution and storage cap
- Three-point calibration solution (pH 4, 7, 10)
- Tris buffer
- DI water
- [pH logger manuals](https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Protocols/tree/master/References_and_Manuals/HOBO_pH_Logger)



<a name=Configuration></a> **Configuration and Launching**  

1. Open HOBOmobile app.

2. Push the button with arrow on top of the logger to connect to the app.

3. Select "Configure & Start" and follow the prompts.

<a name=Calibration></a> **4, 7, 10 Calibration**

1. If the calibration is more than 7 days old, the HOBOmobile app will automatically prompt to recalibrate when you select "Configure & Start".

2. Rinse the probe with DI water.

2. Fill sensor cap with appropriate 4, 7, or 10 buffer and follow the apps instructions to calibrate. Be sure to rinse probe with DI water between calibrating with each buffer.

**Tris Calibration**

1. Once the sensor is launched and calibrated with 4, 7, 10 solution, it will need to also be calibrated with Tris buffer before deployment.

2. Fill sensor cap with Tris buffer and move the entire sensor to the appropriate temperature ranges. Record the time that you begin calibrating.

<a name=Deployment></a> **Deployment**  

1. After Tris calibrating, allow the instrument to continue logging until deployment. HOBOware will need these calibration points included with the deployment data for processing.

2. Leave pH sensor submerged in KCl solution until ready to submerge in sea water.

3. When ready to deploy, take off the KCl storage cap and attach the anti-biofouling copper guard to the sensor.

3. Deploy the logger so that it is secure and will not be moved by currents or surge.

4. Note the time of deployment with the last three digits of the Serial Number and the GPS coordinates.

<a name="Data_Retrieval"></a> **Data Retrieval**
  

1. When sensor is collected, make sure to immediately place the cap on the sensor. This can be temporarily filled with seawater and then switched to KCl upon returning to the lab.

2. Open HOBOmobile app.

3. Push the button with arrow on top of the logger to connect to the app.

4. Select "Stop Logger".

5. Select "Download Data".

<a name="Maintenance"></a> **Maintenance and Storage**  

1. Soak or thoroughly rinse with DI water all instruments that were submerged in salt water.

2. Dry around the probe sensor.  Fill the clear screw-on cap 1/2 to 2/3 with storage solution, and screw the cap onto the probe end of the logger, ensuring the probe tip will remain submerged during storage.

3. Allow the rest of the probe to dry, or wipe dry and store in a secure location.
