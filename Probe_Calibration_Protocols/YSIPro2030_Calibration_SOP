    1. Calibrate probe 24 hours before sampling. You will only be calibrating the conductivity of the probe.
    1. Attach cable with probe to meter. 
    1. Fill tall container with fresh, traceable YSI 3169 conductivity calibration solution. The conductivity sensor is located at the top of the probe and will need to be submerged in the solution.
    1. Place sensor into solution. Make sure probe is entirely submered in the solution. Gently agitate the probe to remove any air bubbles from conductivity sensor. 
    1. Turn the instrument on and allow the conductitiy and temperature readings to stabilize. Press the Cal key. Highlight Conducivity and press enter.
    1. Highlight the desired calibration method Sp. Conductance and press enter. 
    1. Highlight units you wish to calibrate (mS/cm) and press enter. Use the up and down arrow to enter the value of conductivity solution at 25 &deg; C (which should be 50,000 ms/cm)
    1. The Pro2030 will remember the calibration value and display it the next time you calibrate the probe. 
    1. Press enter to complete the calibration. Or press Cal to cancel the calibration. 
    1. 'Calibration successful' will display for a few sectonds to indicate successful calibration and then the instrument will return to the home screen. 
    1.  If unsuccessful, an error message will appear. See troubleshooting guide for solutions.
