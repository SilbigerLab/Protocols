  *  Orion Star multiparameter meter (measures pH, mV, ORP, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, resistivity, and temperature)
  *  3-point pH calibration solutions (4, 7, and 10 at 25 &deg; C)
  *  Chem Wipes
  *  DI water

1. Calibrating pH
    1. pH should be calibrated <24 hours before use.
    1. Fill a small clean beaker with DI water, and pour the three calibration solutions (pH of 4, 7, and 10) into three clean beakers, and place near your work station.
    1. Turn on the meter and wait for the measurement screen to appear.
        1. Make sure the current measurement is for pH.  If not, Either change the Channel (press F3 to swap between probe inputs) or Mode (pressing the Mode button on the meter to swap between measurements using the current Channel's probe) until the instrument is reading pH.
    1. Press F1 to select "cal" and go into Calibration settings.  You should see a prompt screen for the meter to read the first calibration solution.
    1. Remove the probe from the storage solution
        1. First unscrew the lid from the small storage container.
        1. Once the probe and storage cap are able to be lifted from the storage container, slide the cap off the probe.
    1. Rinse the probe in DI water to remove any storage solution, and dry the probe (but not the sensor tip) with a chem wipe.
    1. Place the probe into the pH 4 solution, fully submerging the sensor tip, and agitate the probe tip back and forth briefly.
    1. Press F2 to Start the first calibration and wait for the reading to stabilize.
        1. The probe should read 4.01 at the lab's ambient temperature of 22-23 &deg; C
    1. Once the reading has stabilized at a reasonable value, press F2 for the Next calibration.
    1. Rinse the probe in DI and dry with a chem wipe (again avoiding the sensor tip) before placing the probe in the pH 7 solution, and then agitate the probe tip back and forth briefly.
    1. Wait for a stable reading (7.01 at 22-23 &deg; C) then press F2 for the Next calibration.
    1. Rinse the probe in DI and dry with a chem wipe (again avoiding the sensor tip) before placing the probe in the pH 10 solution, and then agitate the probe tip back and forth briefly.
    1. Wait for a stable reading (10.04 at 22-23 &deg; C) then press F3 to Finish calibration.
    1. If you are satisfied with the three calibration values on the summary screen, press F1 to return to the Measurement screen.
1. Calibrating Conductivity
<a name="Cleaning and Storage"></a> 1. Cleaning and Storage
    1. When you have finished using the meter, thoroughly rinse all probes, especially sensor tips, with DI water.
    1. Dry probes (avoiding sensor tips) with chem wipes.
    1. pH probe
        1. Unscrew the storage container cap from the container, and slide the cap onto the probe shaft, far enough that the sensor tip will be submerged in the storage solution, but not so far that the cap will not full screw onto the container.
        1. If needed, refill the storage solution.
        1. Place the probe into the container and screw on the cap.
        1. Check to make sure the sensor tip is fully submerged.
        1. **Do not** try to force the sensor tip further into the solution while the cap is screwed on or you may damage the probe.
