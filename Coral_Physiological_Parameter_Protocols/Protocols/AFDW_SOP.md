    1. 	Aluminum pans
    1. 	Drying oven (60°C)
    1. 	Muffle furnace (450°C)
    1. 	Analytical balance (0.0001 g)

    1.  Obtain aluminum weigh pans to be used in AFDW determination
    1.  Label each pan with an ID number. May use a spatula to scrape a # into bottom of pan, or use pencil. Marker WILL burn
    	off!
    1.  After labeling, burn in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4-6 h (some papers use 500°C for 4 or 6). After, remove from
    	the muffle furnace, place in a glass desiccator and transport to the scale room.
	** Take care after this point that pans are not touched without gloves on, and that pans are ALWAYS sat on burned
	aluminum foil on tabletops and in ovens/furnaces/scales **
    1.  Record weight of burned pans on 4-decimal place scale (= “C” in Table 1.)
    1.  Keep pans in desiccator until used
    1.  Pipette three triplicate 1mL blastate samples into pre-burned pans, dry in drying oven at 60°C for at least 24 h. 
    	Should be “at constant weight”. Preliminary steps may be needed to ensure samples have reached a constant weight. 
	Leaving samples in drying oven longer than 24 h may be necessary, and is likely not detrimental.
    1.  After samples have reached a constant weight, weigh pan + dried samples on a 4- decimal scale and record weight (= “D” 
    	in Table 1.)
    1.  The difference in (D – C) is the dry tissue biomass (= “E” in Table 1.)
    1.  After recording the weight of the burned pan + dry tissue (and salts), place in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4-6 h. 
    	Most literature uses a 6h burn period, but in preliminary tests of blastate 4h is sufficient to burn off the well 
	dispersed (high SA of blastate in pans) residue. Oven also stays hot after turning off, so even at 4h (30 ramp up, 30 
	min ramp down + residual heat in oven…) the oven will be hot for some time.
	*NOTE: The organic fraction will burn off at 450°C leaving only salt and inorganics behind. The difference between the
	dry weight and burned weight is the organic fractionof coral biomass.
    1.  Let pans cool and place in desiccator and transport to the scale room. Avoid transporting when warm, it will cause
    	water to adhere to pans.
    1.  Measure weight of burned pan + burned tissue (“D” – “F” in Table 1.). This is the AFDW of the organic fraction
    1.  The AFDW will be biomass (g) for each ml of tissue added, or area of skeleton.
    1.  In Table 1. Ex: 0.0463 (g) / 3 ml tissue = 0.0154 (g) biomass/ml blastate

 A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  |  G |
----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Sample ID | Sample volume (mL) | Burned pan (g) | Burned pan + Dry residue (g) | Dry tissue biomass (g) | Burned pan + burned residue (g) | AFDW (g/mL) |
Calculations | | | | = D-C | | = D-F |
