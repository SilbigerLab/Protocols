<a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**

1. SAS
1. Phillips head screwdriver 
1. Phillips screw (6/32" X 1")
1. Strong magnet
1. IR remote
1. Lithium ion batteries (x8)
1. Large black zipties
1. Carabiners

*When not in use, keep lying in horizontal position.* 
1. Remove screws, loosening each one a little and moving on to the next in a circular motion so as not to crack the screen. Remove plastic screen and gently lift out inner compartment. 
2. Remove battery packs, load batteries, and plug packs into sampler. Make sure to plug battery pack into compartment #1 BEFORE compartment #2. 
3. Gently replace inner compartment, making sure no wires are compressed or at an angle. Replace screen & screws, again moving in a circle when tightening the screws.
5. Check that screen is on <STATUS MENU>. Point IR remote directly at screen and use right cursor to navigate to <TIME SET>. Confirm that time and date are correct; if not, use cursor to set correct date and set time to the nearest next minute (e.g. if it is 10:01, set time to 10:02:00). Scroll down to “ENTER SET” and press enter when real time matches set time (e.g. when real clock says 10:02). First row T is 24H time, HH:MM:SS. Second row D is DD/MM/YY. 
6. Return to top of <TIME SET> screen and navigate to <SETTINGS>. Confirm that settings are “Mode: Once” and “VOL: 900” (900 mL); if not, change using cursor, then scroll to “ENTER SET” and press enter.
7. Return to top of <SETTINGS> screen and navigate to <PUMP A>. Set T (time) and D (date) to the time and date for Pump A to turn on, then scroll to “ENTER SET” and press enter. Time is 24H time, HH:MM. Date is DD/MM/YY. Return to top of <PUMP A> screen, navigate to <PUMP B>, and repeat steps to program time and date for Pump B to turn on.
8. Return to top of <PUMP B> screen and navigate to <INITIATE>. Scroll to “Press Enter” and press enter. 
9. To wake sampler, move magnet back and forth horizontally across reed switch. When display says “Interrupt”, hold magnet in position until main screen turns on. Initiation (step 5) must be pressed again if you wish to return to sampling mode.
10. When removing battries, make sure to remove battery from compartment #2 BEFORE compartment #1.

Instructional video for attaching one Mylar and one Tedlar bag to the sampler [here.](https://youtu.be/R16RRaiNpqU) 
Be sure to keep Tedlar bag valve closed unless SAS is actively sampling. Close valve after deployment before removing SAS from the field.

 – Time is 24H time, HH:MM:SS.
 – Date is DD/MM/YY.
 – Mode: Once; VOL: 900
1. Program <PUMP A> & <PUMP B> sample times.
1. Enter <INITIATE> to turn on sampling mode.
1. Use magnet to wake sampler, hold at “Interrupt.”
1. Battery pack OUT: #2 before #1.
