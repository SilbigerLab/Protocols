*When not in use, keep lying in horizontal position.* 
1. Load batteries into battery packs and plug packs into sampler. Make sure to plug battery pack into compartment #1 BEFORE compartment #2. 
1. Check that screen is on <STATUS MENU>. Point IR remote directly at screen and use right cursor to navigate to <TIME SET>. Confirm that time and date are correct; if not, use cursor to set correct date and set time to the nearest next minute (e.g. if it is 10:01, set time to 10:02:00). Scroll down to “ENTER SET” and press enter when real time matches set time (e.g. when real clock says 10:02). First row T is 24H time, HH:MM:SS. Second row D is DD/MM/YY. 
1. Return to top of <TIME SET> screen and navigate to <SETTINGS>. Confirm that settings are “Mode: Once” and “VOL: 900”; if not, change using cursor, then scroll to “ENTER SET” and press enter.
1. Return to top of <SETTINGS> screen and navigate to <PUMP A>. Set T (time) and D (date) to the time and date for Pump A to turn on, then scroll to “ENTER SET” and press enter. Time is 24H time, HH:MM. Date is DD/MM/YY. Return to top of <PUMP A> screen, navigate to <PUMP B>, and repeat steps to program time and date for Pump B to turn on.
1. Return to top of <PUMP B> screen and navigate to <INITIATE>. Scroll to “Press Enter” and press enter. 
1. To wake sampler, move magnet back and forth horizontally across reed switch. When display says “Interrupt”, hold magnet in position until main screen turns on. Initiation (step 5) must be pressed again if you wish to return to sampling mode.
