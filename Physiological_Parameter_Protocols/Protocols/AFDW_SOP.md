    1. 	Aluminum pans
    1. 	Drying oven (60°C)
    1. 	Muffle furnace (450°C)
    1. 	Analytical balance (0.0001 g)

    1.  Make sure desiccant in lab is blue in color. If pink/purple, put in *drying* oven at 60°C for a few hours using alumnium foil tray or until the material is blue again. 
    1.  Obtain aluminum weigh pans to be used in AFDW determination
    1.  Label each pan with an ID number. May use a spatula to scrape a # into bottom of pan, or use pencil. Marker WILL burn
    	off!
    1.  After labeling, stack the trays and note/draw diagram of how they are placed in the furnance in case labels burn off. Place in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4-6 h (some papers use 500°C for 4 or 6). 
    1.  After 4-6 h, reduce temperature to ~ 100°C before transfering items by opening up the furnance vent and powering down the system. You can also periodically open the door to the furnance if needed. This will take ~ 1 h. 
    1.  After a cooldown period, remove from the muffle furnace using metal tongs and place in directly in a glass desiccator and transport to the scale room.
	** Take care after this point that pans are not touched without gloves on, and that pans are ALWAYS sat on burned
	aluminum foil on tabletops and in ovens/furnaces/scales **
    1.  Record weight of burned pans on 4-decimal place scale (= “C” in Table 1.)
    1.  Keep pans in desiccator until used.
    1.  Pipette three triplicate 1mL blastate samples into pre-burned pans, dry in drying oven at 60°C for at least 24 h. 
    	Should be “at constant weight”. Preliminary steps may be needed to ensure samples have reached a constant weight. 
	Leaving samples in drying oven longer than 24 h may be necessary, and is likely not detrimental.
    1.  After samples have reached a constant weight, weigh pan + dried samples on a 4- decimal scale and record weight (= “D” 
    	in Table 1.)
    1.  The difference in (D – C) is the dry tissue biomass (= “E” in Table 1.)
    1.  After recording the weight of the burned pan + dry tissue (and salts), place in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4-6 h. 
    	Most literature uses a 6h burn period, but in preliminary tests of blastate 4h is sufficient to burn off the well 
	dispersed (high SA of blastate in pans) residue. Oven also stays hot after turning off, so even at 4h (30 ramp up, 30 
	min ramp down + residual heat in oven…) the oven will be hot for some time.
	*NOTE: The organic fraction will burn off at 450°C leaving only salt and inorganics behind. The difference between the
	dry weight and burned weight is the organic fractionof coral biomass.
    1.  Let pans cool and place in desiccator and transport to the scale room. Avoid transporting when warm, it will cause
    	water to adhere to pans.
    1.  Measure weight of burned pan + burned tissue (“D” – “F” in Table 1.). This is the AFDW of the organic fraction
    1.  The AFDW will be biomass (g) for each ml of tissue added, or area of skeleton.
    1.  In Table 1. Ex: 0.0463 (g) / 3 ml tissue = 0.0154 (g) biomass/ml blastate

Day 1: Measuring and Burning Pans

   1.  All organisms weighed for mass and measured for volume prior to freezing.
 
   2.  Obtain aluminum weigh boats; these will be used for ashing and in AFDW determination calculations.

   3.  Use a sharp tool to scrape labels into the bottom of the weigh boat, labeling each pan with an ID number (marker will burn). 
       Each pan will match the organism ID. It is recommended to draw a diagram to map out the placement of the organisms.

   4.  After labeling, burn in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4 h (turn on the fume hood). Oven stays hot after turning off,
       so even at 4h (30 ramp up, 30 min ramp down + residual heat in oven…) the oven will be hot for some time  (Paine, 1971). 
       Let the pans cool with the door open,  for at least 1-2 hours before you take them out and put them in the desiccant. 
  
   5.  Remove using metal tongs from the muffle furnace, place in a glass desiccator with blue desiccant (if desiccant is not blue
       then dry), and transport to the scale room. *NOTE: This point onwards, ensure that pans are not touched without gloves on and
       that pans are ALWAYS sat on burned aluminum foil on tabletops and in ovens/furnaces/scales 
  
   6.  Record weight of burned pans using metal tongs to transform pan to teh scale and weigh on a 4-decimal place scale (= “C” in
       Table 2.)
   
Day 2: Measuring and Drying Organisms 

   1. Remove organisms from freezer to thaw a few hours prior to beginning the following protocol steps. 

   2. Prepare organisms for burning. For snails, since the shell does not respire and we are only concerned with body mass that
      respires, we separate shells from body tissue. Using forceps, pull out tissue and place the shells to the side. 
      *NOTE: Make sure organism tissue is clearly labeled as the label placed on the shells will no longer be attached to  them. 

   3. Place each individual organism into a pre-burned aluminum weigh pan, drying in the oven at 60°C for at least 24 h. Ensure 
      that the organism's weights no longer change and remain constant by weighing multiple times (they may sit in the drying oven
      for as long as needed, e.g., 48 -72 hours).

   4. After samples have reached a constant weight, weigh pan + dried samples on a 4- decimal scale and record weight (= “D” in Table
      2.) The difference in (D – C) is the dry tissue biomass (= “E” in Table 2.) This will give you the data for organism dry
      weights. You can select a few individuals to do this with to ensure the weight is not increase 0.003g.

Day 3: Measuring and Drying Organisms 

   1. After recording the weight of the burned pan + dry tissue (and salts), place in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4 h. 
      *NOTE: The organic fraction will burn off at 450°C leaving only salt and inorganics behind. The difference between the dry
      weight and burned weight is the organic fraction of organism biomass.

   2. Let pans cool and place in desiccator and transport to the scale room. Avoid transporting when warm, it will cause water to
      adhere to pans.

   3. Measure weight of burned pan + burned tissue (“D” – “F” in Table 2.). This is the AFDW of the organic fraction - the data for
      organism burn weights. 

   4. The ash-free dry weight will be biomass (g) for each g of tissue.
