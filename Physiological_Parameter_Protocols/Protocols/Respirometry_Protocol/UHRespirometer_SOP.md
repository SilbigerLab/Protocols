<a name="StirPlate"></a> **Stir Plate Setup**

1. Cover the stir plates with plastic double bags and plug them in, they CANNOT get wet!  
2. To turn on stir plates push button and adjust speed with knob, hold button in to turn off. 

  
<a name="Lights"></a> **Lights Setup**

1. Put a zip tie on each side of the top of the respo stands, can mark on PVC where these are for future use. 
  Easiest to pull these zip ties tight to know they are even 
3. Clip the caribiners on the light wires to the zip ties
4. Use a level to make sure the lights are leveled and each respo stand has the an equal height. 
  To adjust the light height, pinch top down and slide the along the wire to desired height, screw the bottom in to tighten.
5. Plug in lights
6. The lights have two channels (blue & white light)
7. Hold button on the side of the light to turn on, hold for 3 seconds to turn off. 
8. Adjustments: 
    1. Press knob unit Ch1 or Ch2 is displayed and turn knob for desired intensity. 
    1. Turn knob to change the light intensity
        1. Ch2 White (i.e 20 white)
        2. Ch1 Blue  (i.e 100 blue)
9. Test light levels by placing apogee in the center of each water bath bucket that the chambers are in to make sure there is equal amount of light in each stand. 


<a name="Bath"></a> **Water Bath Setup**

1. Place the cooler and second bin in close proximity to their respective chillers and within reach of the heaters and probes connected to the temperature controllers.  Fill the second bin with the water you'll use to fill the chambers (here called "source water") and set up an InkBird controller (or Apex) to control the temperature of that water.  
2. Fill the cooler with source water, enough to just fully submerge the chambers once the respirometer and chambers are placed inside.

3. Connect tubing to the inflow (larger ID) and outflow (smaller ID) ports on your chillers.  At the free end of the inflow tube, attach an aquarium pump. Place the pump and the free end of the outflow tube in the cooler (repeat for the second bin).  Plug the pump into a any free wall outlet (not a temperature controller outlet).

4. Place the Apex or InkBird temperature probe in the water and check that the display (or apex.local dashboard on your computer) is showing an accurate current temperature reading.  
  
5. Before plugging the chiller and heater into the Apex EnergyBar, make sure the outlets are manually OFF.  Set these outlets to AUTO only once you've programmed the outlets for your desired temperature.  Pre-set the InkBird temperature before plugging in the chiller and heater.
    1. **The heater(s) must be fully submerged before powering on**  

6. While you wait for the bath and source water to reach the desired temperature, set up the respirometer and prepare the chambers.  


<a name="Chambers"></a> **Filling and Securing Chambers**

1. Open up the chamber lid (mason jars) and place a magnetic stir bar in each jar. Once the source water is at the desired temperature, submerge the chamber top and bottom and shake off or wipe away any air bubbles.  
    1. If using 3D printed stands inside the jars, make sure to first saturate them in the source water. 
    1. If including organisms, secure them in the bottom of the chamber or stand before screwing the top and bottom together until **finger tight**.  Check again for bubbles and remove any as necessary.  **Record the time of when you seal each chamber** and leave submerged to maintain temperature until ready to secure on the respirometer.  
    1. If the probes will reach the submerged chamber without straining the wire, [insert the probes into the chamber](#Probes) at this time before placing the chambers onto the respirometer.
    

1. Place the chamber on the stir plate until the stir bars are in the center of each jar, and are not hitting anything (sides, stand, organism). You should be able to fit 6 jars on each stir plate. 
    1. Loosen the probe placement holes and put the probes in, tighten the probe placement around the probe. 
    1. Take the cap of the O2 probe, can add electrical tape around the O2 probe to make a better seal. 
    1. Careful to not damage the probes or introduce bubbles to the chamber, insert the temperature probe into the larger probe port and gently guide it down until it fits snuggly and securely.
    1. Once the temperature probe is in place, gently guide the oxygen probe into its port, being careful to not scratch the probe tip.  The probe tip should be at least 2 cm into the chamber, but can be inserted farther, as long as the probe isn't touching any organisms or objects in the chamber.  

1. After you wipe all the bubbles outside of the chamber while submerged in the source water, fill the jars as full as you can. 
    1. Put the stir bar and organism in, if not already. 
    1. Place the chamber in the water bath and add more water to fill it completely. 
    1. Wet lid and make sure that bubbles are not on it. Put lid on. 
    1. Tilt the jar around or gently tap on sides to get bubbles out through small hole on top of lid. 
    1. Fill a syringe and push water through the hole to guide bubbles out. 
    1. Plug the hole with parfilm. 
    1. Make sure there are no bubbles. 
    1. If there are large bubbles, that you cannot fix, make sure that the lid is fully sealed and the probes have no air coming through. The chamber lid may need to be hot glued if you are unable to fix the issue. 
    
1. Repeat for all 12 chambers, filling at least one chamber on each stir plate with only water, without any organisms, for a "background" dataset.

<a name="Final_Checks"></a> **Final Checks**

Last checks before starting to record data using the PreSens program:  

1. Stir bars spinning in place and at normal speed (If not, the battery needs to be switched out and recharged - see [**Take-Down**](#Take-Down) instructions for proper procedures)  

1. Chambers are securely fastened on the respirometer stand  

1. No bubbles are present inside the chambers  

1. The correct probes are in the correct chambers (Every numbered temperature probe is with its corresponding numbered oxygen probe and in the numbered chamber you've assigned to the probe pair)  

1. The probes are snug and secure in the chambers  

<a name="Water_Change"></a> **Water Changeover for Additional Runs**

If using the respirometer at more than one temperature  

1. Once all the chambers are out of the source water and you've started recording data for your current run, do a water change (if necessary) of your source water and program the Apex to your new desired temperature.  

1. Once you've stopped recording data for your current run, program the Apex for the water bath to your new desried temperature (same as the source water).  

1. While you wait for the temperature in your bath water to stabilize, collect water samples, if needed for your data set, or start [preparing the chambers](#Chambers) with the new source water using the same steps above.

<a name=Changeover_with_temp_rampup></a>
**Follow these steps for thorough changeover procedures during respiration with temperature ramp-ups:**

1. Stop each channel individually and write down the stop time.
2. On the Apex Dashboard, edit the temperature programs for the next temperature treatment to bring water bath to target temp.
3. In PreSens, export the last run's data files in the desired folder location. Open one of the csv files to make sure they exported correctly (is there data?).
4. Assign the next run's files to each channel.
5. In RStudio Terminal:
    - git pull
    - git add .
    - git commit -a -m "relevant commit message here"
    - git push
6. As temperature nears target in the water bath, use the digital thermometer to spot check the temperature and Calibrate the Apex 'tmp' probe to the actual temperature.
7. Once the water bath is at or near the target, fill the chambers in a filler bath (chamber source water) already at target temperature and put chambers on the respirometry stand with probes in preparation.
8. Once all chambers are placed, with stir bars going, no bubbles, and at target temperature, start the run for each individual channel at write down the time (turn off the light if necessary).
9. After starting the run, change the temperature setting on the inkbird to the next target temperature to begin bringing up the filler bath temp in preparation for the next run.
10. If needed, in the last few minutes of the current run, move over the 800W heater from the water bath to assist in temperature ramp up in the filler bath. Make sure you move the 800W heater back to the water bath once the run has ended so the water bath temperature can ramp up quickly.

<a name="Removing"></a> **Removing Chambers from Respirometer**

1. To take the volume of the water in the chamber. 
    1. Bring the chamber over a clean container, open the chamber while overtop of the bin. 
    1. Pour water inside of the container. 
    1. Remove stir bar and organism out of container. 
    1. Pour liquid from container into a graduate cylinder and record the volume. 

1. Remove the probes and carefully place or drape them in a secure location.  

1. Unscrew the holding plates and remove the chambers.  

1. If collecting water samples, note the time when you either unscrew the airlock seal on the lid (best method for pouring the water into another container) or unscrew the bottom (keep the chamber upside down for this method).  

1. Unscrew the bottom of the chamber to fully drain the water, then place the two chamber parts in the source water.  
    1. If you have any organisms secured in the bottom of the chamber, be as swift as possible to minimize time spent out of the water.  

1. Keep the chamber lid very near or loosely on top of the chamber bottom, unscrewed, to not confuse which organism goes in which numbered chamber, while still allowing for water flow until you're ready to move the chambers to the water bath.

1. Once the source water and water bath are at the desired temperature, follow the same steps to [fill and secure the chambers](#Chambers) to prepare for your next run.  
    

<a name="Take-Down"></a> **Respirometer Take-Down and CleanUp**

1. Store or dispose of organisms as appropriate.

1. Drain the source water bin and fill with fresh water.

1. Place the unsealed chambers, stir bars, heaters, aquarium pumps, and temperature probes in the bin to soak, keeping all outlet plugs out and away from the water.  
    1. Let the pumps run for some time (without the chiller being on) to flush fresh water through the hoses.  

1. Taking the respirometer out of the water bath  
    1. When lifting the stand out of the bath, keep it tilted slightly so that the lid to the battery compartment is lower than the opposite side with the power switch.  
    1. If any water seeped into the battery compartment, this will force the water away from other electrical components of the compartment.  
    1. Drain the water bath and refill with fresh water.  Place the respirometer in the fresh water to soak.  

1. While letting everything soak, collect and organize the Oxy-10 probes so the Oxygen probes are together and the temperature probes are together  
    1. Fill two beakers with DI water and gently drape the probes over a line or surface so the probe tips (any portion exposed to the water) are submerged in DI, with O2 probes in one beaker and temp probes in another.  

1. Breaking down the respirometer after soaking  
    1. Lift the respirometer out of the freshwater bath using the same tilt method as before.
    1. Remove the parafilm and use a boa grip to loosen the cap utnil you can unscrew it by hand.  
    1. Take out the battery and detach the positive and negative clips from the battery terminals.  
    1. Check for any leaked water by wiping a towel, cloth, or chemwipe around the inside of the compartment.  
    1. Place the respirometer on a stable surface to dry overnight (with the battery compartment opening-side down).  

1. Using a clean rag or chemwipe with ethanol, wipe down the cord of each Oxy-10 probe to remove any remaining salt deposits or particulates, then recoil the probes and store in their original labeled bags.  
    1. Refer to the [**PreSens SOP**](/Coral_Physiological_Parameter_Protocols/Protocols/Respirometry_Protocol/PreSens_SOP.md) for proper handling and storage of the probes.  

1. Leave items to soak overnight if possible, then remove from the fresh water and place on a clean surface to dry.
