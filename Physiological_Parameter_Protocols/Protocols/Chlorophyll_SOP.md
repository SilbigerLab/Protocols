    1.  Airbrush coral fragment with filtered seawater (0.2 μm), homogenize blastate, and note final volume
    1.  Vortex and aliquot out two 3 ml samples of tissue blastate into two pre-labeled falcon tubes. Samples may be frozen at            
        -20°C or -80°C for future analysis. 
    1.  Using your unfrozen samples, centrifuge each of the samples at ca. 3,450 rpm for ca. 3 min. This will pellet all 
        symbiont along with some host debris in each sample.
    1.  Remove supernatant and discard in a waste container using pipette
    1.  Make sure all lights are turned off in the lab. Then, add 5 ml of 100% acetone to each of the pellets, make sure you 
        cover the falcon tubes COMPLETELY with aluminum foil. Equations from Jeffrey and Humphrey specify 100% acetone for 
        dinoflagellates. 6.Disturb pellet by poking, grinding it with acetone-cleaned forceps to aid in mixing and breaking 
        apart pellet. Clean the forceps after each use with chemwipes. Note, chlorophyll is not stable and degrades in the 
        presence of light. Make sure to keep samples/tube rack in aluminum foil to maintain darkness. 
    1.  Extract chlorophyll for 36 hours in darkness in a flammable safe freezer (-20°C) overnight. 
    
    <<< following period of extraction >>
    
    1.  Spin down samples at ca. 3,450 rpm for 3 minute. Take care not to disturb pellet.
    1.  Pipette out three technical triplicate aliquots (2.5mL) for each sample and read absorbance on spectrophotometer at 
        663 nm and 630 nm and 750 nm. The 750 nm is an internal blank. Use 100% acetone blanks between each triplicate. 
        (reference spectrophotometer protocol)
    1.  Turbidity of the sample and solvent absorbance can be corrected for by reading absorbance at 750 nm. Chlorophyll a 
        absorbance peak is at 663 nm; chlorophyll c2 peak is at 630 nm.
    1.  Once analyzed, dispose of acetone into a labeled glass waste container and rinse cuvette with 100% acetone and MQ 
        water.
    1.  Calculate chlorophyll (μg/ml) a concentrations using equations below: (1cm cuvette) Chlorophyll a = 11.43 (A663 - A750  
        / PL) – 0.64(A630 – A750/PL)

	where PL = pathlength in cm.
	
		*The pathlength of a cuvette = 1 cm
		*Normalize to denominator of choice (protein, surface area, biomass…)
