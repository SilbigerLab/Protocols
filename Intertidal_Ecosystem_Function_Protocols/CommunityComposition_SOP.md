  *  2 buckets
  *  Conical flexible mesh gridded-quadrat with 10 x 10 cm grid windows
  *  2 demarcated metal chains and transect tape (for tide pool perimeter)
  *  1-2 siphon hand pumps
  *  Datasheets
  *  Notebooks
  *  Field identification guides

  1. Mark water perimeter with metal chain. For larger pools or pools with emergent biomass, mark extra perimeter or emergent biomass with transect tape after chains run out of length. Mark end of chain with plastic tie to get tide pool perimeter (measured back at lab with transect tape).
  1. Remove water from pool with buckets and water pumps. Leave one bucket full of water next to pool for any fish present in pool
  1. Place flexible mesh quadrat flesh with the bottom of the pool.
  1. Team leader counts # of squares on the perimeter, then the interior of the pool (team leader is the only one that does percent cover to minimize bias) to get tide pool surface area
  1. For percent cover, team leader counts the number of squares each sessile organism is occupying
    	1. Top canopy percent cover is done first (Surfgrass and epiphytes in surfgrass pools and mussels and epiphytes in mussel pools)
    	1. To get subcanopy percent cover, go section by section to get substrate measurements (e.g. CCA, Sand, bare rock, etc.) and record on notebook
  1. As percent cover is measured (especially in surfgrass pools when substrate is exposed), assistant and team leader count mobile organisms. 
		1. Photographs of unknowns were taken for taxonomic ID if they could not be identified using field guides.
  1. After community composition is completed, place >= half the tide pool water back into pool making sure to wash down edges of pools to prevent dessication of organisms. 
  1. Take photos of datasheet and notebooks in between each tide pool. Add all data from notebook and transfer to datasheet at end of field day to reduce calculation time in the field.
