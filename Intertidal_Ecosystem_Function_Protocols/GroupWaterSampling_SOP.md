Original: 20190707

Last Revised: 20190712

* Person 1: Jenn Fields (at intertidal chem lab station)
* Person 2: Multiparameter prometer measurer and data recorder (tide pools)
* Person 3: Water pumper/runner (tide pools)
* Person 4: pH measurer/runner (chem lab station)
***
**Prep for water sampling**
***
1. Arrive at site 1.5-2 hours before the start of sampling time
2. Carry gear down to beach
3. Bring buckets of ocean water and rinse all biogeochemistry containers (erlenmeyer flasks, tubing, 50 mL centrifuge tubes, 250 mL nalgene bottles, syringes and holders) three times with ocean water. 
4. Once then tide goes down, walk to where chemistry lab will be set up.
	1.	**Person 1** Set up Chemistry lab. 
		2.	Probe stand with pH and temperature probes in 50 mL centrifuge cap and tube in tupperware on cooler for nutrient samples; pipette set to 1000mL with tips; 250 mL bottles for TA; 50 mL centrifuge tubes in styrofoam holders; 2 mL tubes in holders pretreated with 1mL paraformaldehyde; fDOM  containers; filters (have all set up for easier access), syringe with holders and stopcocks.
		3.	When the tide is low enough, set tubing with stopper with weights at the deepest part of the pool. For night sampling, place glow sticks at each pool.

	1. **Person 2-4** 
		2. Assist with set-up until water sampling time. 
		3. Buckets organized with Erlenmeyer flasks (with closed tops) order from last to first pools (e.g. days/nights with tide pools 1-16, 16 on bottom and 1 on top; days/nights with tide pools 17-32, 18 on bottom and 26-29 on top (26-29 were the lowest pools so those were done first each sampling period after night 1)
		3. Ocean sample Erlenmeyer flask bungee corded to lacrosse stick
		4. Multiparameter pro meter ready in bucket. 
		5. This will mean a total of 3 buckets will go with each journey (one with probe, two with grouping of flasks).
		6. Hand vacuum pump with tubing attached to first tide pool bottle
		7. If necessary, all pools are marked with GPS. Walk through how to use the GPS and what track to follow with Person 1 before leaving chem station. Using the GPS, find ocean and tide pools to sample for time points 1-5.

Once all the pools are exposed around 3 hours before low tide, water sampling can start.

**During water sampling at the beginning of each time point**
***
**Person 1** 

Continue to organize station as group collects first water samples

**Ocean sample**

**Person 2 and 3** 

Go to site designated by person one at the beginning of each time period
* Person 2: Places multiparameter probe into ocean. Make sure top of probe is covered (that’s where the conductivity is measured. Agitate the probe to get rid of bubbles). Wait 20 seconds after measurements stabilizes and record time of first sampling point and data (DO mg/L, %, conductivity, salinity and temp) for probe measurements.
* Person 3: Bungee cord and zip-tie Erlenmeyer flask to lacrosse stick basket. Rinse flask three times then fill with ocean water and cap top with stopped without hole and nozzle with balloon. Take water sample near where Person 1 is taking ocean water sample. 

**Person 4** Meet person 2 and 3 to bring back ocean sample with buckets of Erlenmeyer flasks for tide pools and hand pump
Take filled flask to chemistry lab station and move on to other tide pools.

**Tide Pools**
1. At tide pool, **Person 2** uses multiparameter probe next to tubing to measure DO, conductivity, conductivity, salinity and temperature. Same thing as ocean sample. Agitate probe so bubbles are released and make sure the top of probe is under water. Wait until the DO starts to stabilize (around 20 seconds) then record data.
2. After **Person 2** is done measuring, **person 3** removes cap of Erlenmeyer flask and replace it with the cap connected to the tubing.   
Before each sampling point, Person 3 hand pumps 10x to flush tubing. Dispose of water on the rocks. 
	3. Attach tube with hand pump to Erlenmeyer flask and hand pump 550 mL on biogeochemistry/microbial sampling points (purple line at time points 1 and 4/5) or 400 mL (black line at time points 2-4) into flask.
		4. 	**Do not over fill** if you do please let person 1 or 4 know.
	5. 	Remove tubing connected to tide pool first to keep vaccuum pressure and replace with the rubber stopper without hole and put balloon or stopper on the nozzle to prevent air from getting in or out of container. 
6. 	After completing 3-5 pools, Person 3 or 4 takes bucket with bottles back to person 1 at chem station. Person 2 and 3 move on to work at next pools. 
7. 	Repeat methods for each time point (1-5)
9. 	Take photo of where in the pool tubing was located. Collect tubing at the end of the last sampling point.

**At chemistry lab**
***
**Person 1** 
1. Have filters already in filter holder and station organized by order of samples. 
2. Receive capped Erlenmeyer flask from field team.

**Person 1 or Person 4 if present**
3. Pore around 20 mL into 50 mL centrifuge tube and twist on to cap with pH and temp probes (cover probes fully)
	* When pH stabilizes, record temperature first then pH. 
	* Fill 250 mL bottle for total alkalinity measurements, leaving a little head space for mercuric chloride addition. 

**Person 1**
4. Pour 50 mL of seawater into syringe connected to filter holder with stopcock in locked position. Place plunger of syringe on then unlock stopcock to side and push water through the filter holder with already pre-loaded 0.7 mm filter. Use same filter for 3 samples. 
	5. **make sure to put stopcock back to prevent the filter breaking when you take the back off. Practice before to get routine in**
6. Place nutrient samples back in cooler after 2 rounds of sampling.
7. On microbial sample times (1 & 4/5), pipette 1mL of unfiltered seawater into 2mL microcentrifuge container pretreated with PFA.
8. Use another syringe with sterivex filter to push 2 x 60 mL onto rocks then 20 mL into fDOM flask, then the remainder on to the rocks.
9. Plunge 2 syringes full of air to flush water out of sterivex. Place sterivex filter and microcentrifuge tubes into small cooler with dry ice after sampling.

**Clean up**
***
**Person 2-3**
* Once completed with sampling, clean probes used with DI water and Kim Wipes and help organize gear back for transport. Start moving gear back to vehicle while person 1 and 4 finishing processing samples

**Person 1 & 4**
1. Clean equipment with DI water and Kim Wipes. 
2. Put most nutrient samples and FDOM samples with ice packs in big cooler, stervix, microcentrifuge containers, and 1 nutrient container in small cooler. 
3. Carry gear back to beach, then to vehicle. 

***
**Back at Lab**
***
1. Place nutrient samples with holders in -20 degree freezer within 5 hours of collection. 
2. Place sterivex filters and 2 mL microcentrifuge container in -80 degree freezer as soon as possible.
3. Place fDOM samples in fridge.
4. (Person 1 and Person 2) Wearing full PPE, place 100 μl of 50% saturated HgCl2 with repeater pipette in each TA samples to preserve the water under fume hood. Have one person open tops of containers one row at a time and put tops back on after HgCl2 is put in to ensure all samples were preserved. 
	2. Parafilm container tops before storing
